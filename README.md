# TankerZ
## User Documentation 
### Description of the program 
This is a simple 2D tank game where the player can shoot enemies to score. 
Enemies come from random locations. The player can also place mines to destroy enemies.  
The player can also shoot health powerups which increases their health. 
When the player misses to destroy an enemy their health would decrease. 
If the player’s health becomes zero, the game will be over. 

* It was created using Qt libraries exclusively (Qt Core & Qt Multimedia). 
* There are no known bugs at this time. 
 
### Limitations 
- Player can only press one button at a time to move. 
- When game over, scene items won’t stop. 
 
### Desired Improvements 
- Add the ability for the player to press multiple keys at a time to move, shoot and place mines. 
- Add difficulty levels for the player to choose. 
- Make the GUI more user friendly.
